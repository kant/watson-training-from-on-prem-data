### Create IBM Cloud service instances

In order to build and train your machine learning model, you'll first need to
[sign up for Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio), which you
can do for free. In our use case, Watson Studio will rely on the Object Storage
service to store it's data, the Apache Spark service for data processing, and
the Machine Learning service for building machine learning models.

From the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/), select the
[**Storage**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=storage) category,
and then the [**Object
Storage**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage)
service. Then, click **Create**.

From the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/), select the
[**Web and
Application**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=app_services)
category, and then the [**Apache
Spark**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apache-spark) service.
Then, click **Create**.

### Load sample data into an on-premise Db2 database

The fastest way to get started with Db2 on-premise is to use the no-charge
community edition, running in a Docker container. However, if you already have
an on-premise Db2 instance, feel free to substitute that instead.

We'll be populating the database with a sample dataset of building code
violations, provided by the city of Chicago.

If you don't already have Docker installed, follow the official [installation
guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

Start by using [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) to
launch Db2 community edition in a container running in the background.

> Including the `--env LICENSE="accept"` argument indicates your acceptance of
> the [license
> agreement](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/displaylis/5DF1EE126832D3F185257DAB0064BEFA?OpenDocument)
> to use the software contained in the Docker image.

This command sets a password for the default instance user (`db2inst1`) to
`db2inst1-pwd` and binds Db2 to listen on port `50000` of your workstation:

```bash
docker run \
  --name db2 \
  --env LICENSE="accept" \
  --env DB2INST1_PASSWORD="db2inst1-pwd" \
  --publish 50000:50000 \
  --detach \
  ibmcom/db2express-c \
  db2start
```

Next, run a `db2` command inside the running container using [`docker
exec`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) as the
`db2inst1` user to [create a
database](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.dbobj.doc/doc/t0004916.html)
named `onprem`:

```bash
docker exec db2 su - db2inst1 -c "db2 CREATE DATABASE onprem"
```

Next, we need to create a regular user for Watson Studio to connect as. Users
in Db2 are managed externally from Db2 itself, so let's create a system user
named `watson`, assign them a password (`secrete`), and grant them
database-level permissions.

```bash
docker exec db2 useradd -g db2iadm1 watson
```

```bash
docker exec db2 bash -c "echo secrete | passwd --stdin watson"
```

```bash
docker exec db2 su - db2inst1 -c "db2 CONNECT TO onprem; db2 'GRANT DBADM, CREATETAB, BINDADD, CONNECT, CREATE_NOT_FENCED, IMPLICIT_SCHEMA, LOAD ON DATABASE TO watson'"
```

Using the new `watson` user account, create a database table in the `watson`
database for building code violations named `violations`:

```bash
docker exec db2 su - db2inst1 -c "db2 CONNECT TO onprem USER watson USING secrete; db2 'CREATE TABLE violations(ID INTEGER, VIOLATION_CODE VARCHAR(20), INSPECTOR_ID VARCHAR(15), INSPECTION_STATUS VARCHAR(10), INSPECTION_CATEGORY VARCHAR(10), DEPARTMENT_BUREAU VARCHAR(30), ADDRESS VARCHAR(250), LATITUDE DOUBLE, LONGITUDE DOUBLE)'"
```

Then, use [`docker
cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/) to push the
[`violations.csv`](violations.csv) file (from this repository) into the `db2`
container.

```bash
docker cp violations.csv db2:/tmp/
```

Load the sample data into the `onprem` database in Db2:

```bash
docker exec db2 su - db2inst1 -c "db2 CONNECT TO onprem USER watson USING secrete; db2 'LOAD FROM /tmp/violations.csv OF DEL REPLACE INTO violations'"
```

At this point, you have a Db2 database instance loaded with sample data.

### Configure a secure gateway to IBM Cloud

To enable Watson studio to access the on-premise database, you'll need to
configure a secure gateway, which allows limited network ingress to your
on-premise network as governed by an access control list (ACL).

Before you begin, you need to take note of your workstation's LAN IP. You can
find that address using:

```bash
$ hostname -I
192.168.1.100
```

> Your workstation may have more than one IP, but any of them will likely work
> for the purposes of this code pattern, because Docker will bind to all
> network interfaces.

> It's worth mentioning that `loopback` addresses (e.g. `127.0.0.1`) will not
> work here, because IBM Cloud services consuming the Secure Gateway will not
> be able to distinguish between their own `loopback` interfaces and a
> `loopback` interface on your end of the Secure Gateway.

For the purposes of this code pattern, we'll assume that your LAN IP is
`192.168.1.100`.

Create a [Secure
Gateway](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/secure-gateway) from the
IBM Cloud Catalog.

![Create a new Secure Gateway](http://browser-testing-cdn.dolphm.com/watson-training-from-on-prem-data-new-secure-gateway.png)

Once the gateway is created, select **Connect Client** and choose **Docker** as
the connection method.

The console will provide you with a complete Docker command to download and run
the secure gateway client, which looks something like `docker run -it
ibmcom/secure-gateway-client $GATEWAY_ID -t $SECURITY_TOKEN` (with a real
gateway ID and security token unique to your Secure Gateway). Use the copy icon
to copy the command, and run it locally.

By default, the gateway starts with an access control list in a default-deny
state, meaning that all incoming connections through the secure gateway will be
blocked from accessing any network resources. To allow Watson Studio to access
your Db2 instance, we need to specifically allow access to the port published
by Docker on your workstation's LAN IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.100`):

    acl allow 192.168.1.100:50000

Incoming connections from Watson Studio which pass through the secure gateway
will now be able to access Db2.

> When you're finished with this code pattern, you can close the secure gateway
> by typing `quit` at the prompt and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

See the
[documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/SecureGateway/index.html#getting-started-with-sg)
for additional configuration options.

### Connect to on-premise Db2 database from Watson Studio

Create a **New Project**.

![Watson Studio home](http://browser-testing-cdn.dolphm.com/watson-training-from-on-prem-data-dataplatform-home.png)

Select **Complete**, when prompted.

Enter `Violations` as the project name, and click **Create**.

![New Watson Studio project](http://browser-testing-cdn.dolphm.com/watson-training-from-on-prem-data-new-project.png)

Near the top right of the screen, select the **Add to project** dropdown, choose
**Connection**, and select **Db2** from the available options.

![Add to Watson Studio project](http://browser-testing-cdn.dolphm.com/watson-training-from-on-prem-data-add-to-project.png)

![New Db2 connection](http://browser-testing-cdn.dolphm.com/watson-training-from-on-prem-data-new-db2-connection.png)

Configure the connection as follows:

* **Name**: `On-Premise`
* **Database**: `onprem`
* **Hostname or IP Address**: your workstation's LAN IP (e.g. `192.168.1.100`)
* **Port**: `50000`
* **Secure Gateway**: &#9745; (and ensure your new Secure Gateway is selected in
  the corresponding dropdown menu)
* **Username**: `watson`
* **Password**: `secrete`

In the secure gateway terminal, you should see a log message indicating that a
connection was successfully established from Watson Studio:

    [2018-08-31 10:38:38.708] [INFO] (Client ID K75lSQ0Oppd_d87) Connection #1 is being established to 192.168.1.100:50000

Click the **Add to Project** dropdown again, and choose **Connected assets**.

Click **Select source**, then choose the **On-Premise** connection, then the
**WATSON** database, then the **VIOLATIONS** table, and finally, click the
**Select** button at the bottom of the screen.

#### Refine the asset

Watson Machine Learning models do not directly support data assets from
on-premise Db2 instances, so we have to setup a conversion process to "refine"
the data asset into a `CSV` file in object storage.

From the **Data assets** table, click on **Violations** (with **Data Asset** in
the **Type** column). At the top right, click **Refine**. We don't need to
manipulate the data, so simply click the "run" button labeled with a
**&#9654;** icon at the top right. The data flow output will show that you're
creating a `CSV` file, which will be saved into your object storage bucket.
Click **Save and Run**. You can then opt to view the data flow's progress by
clicking **View Flow**.

From your project **Assets** screen, you should now see a new **Data asset**
named `Violations_shaped.csv`.

### Create a machine learning model

#### Create a WML model

From your project's **Assets** screen, click **New Watson Machine Learning
model**. Name your model **Violations Predictor**, select your Apache Spark
service instance from the **Spark Service or Environment** dropdown, and click
**Create**.

You'll then be asked to choose your data asset. Use the radio button to select
the CSV file you just created, named `Violations_shaped.csv`, and click
**Next**.

When the data is finished loading, you'll be asked to **Select a technique**.
Choose `INSPECTION_STATUS (String)` as your **Column value to predict (Label
Col)**, and choose **Multiclass Classification** as your technique. Click
**Train**.

When training is complete, click **Save** to store your model.

You can now use the model's endpoint in your own application.
